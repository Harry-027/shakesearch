# ShakeSearch

## Submission & Improvements:

* Word suggestion to user in case of a misspelled word.
* Case insensitive search.
* Trimming out the search result sentences.
* Text highlighting the query word in search result.
* Backend code refactored.

If I would have more time, I would have tried:
* Scalable solution for any given bigger text string (bigger than the one given here - Shakespeare Completework).
* Some kind of asynchronous job for creating indexes & spelling correction model training.
* Multi-word search not limited to exact match.
